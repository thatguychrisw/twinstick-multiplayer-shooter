## Top Down, Procedurally Generated, Multi-player Twin-stick Shooter

###Setting / Explanation of Gameplay

- Multi-player only
- Player connect with one another automatically forming a group in a lobby
- Players are shown in a circle on a platform
- Game count downs like a game show and begins
- Game starts with the players rising from the lobby to the introduction level
- Once the platform stops players have pedestals with different types of weapons on them
- Each player can only select one weapon that has not been previously selected
- Once all players have a weapon the announcer begins the countdown and opens the gate/door starting the game
- Players going through rounds like on a game show
- Each round has the player fighting AI enemies with terrain mutations and obstacles
- Each round may possess an opportunity to affect the boss at the end of a level
- After `X` rounds the players fight a boss
- This style of level continues for `X` levels

###Control Scheme

- **Ps4/Xbox/console control set**
- Left axis - **movement**
- Right axis - **shoot**
- Top paddle/trigger - **combines for different shot types and directions**
- Buttons - **utility options different for each type of weapon**

###Ideas

- Distinct AI enemy behaviors — encourages pattern recognition.
- AI can target players based on the group makeup, weapon selection, etc...

####Weapons

- **Sword**, increasing damage on chained / combo attacks, defensive attack with swiping direction AOE attack with push-back
- **Claw / Animal Suit**, Rolls into enemies, bounces off walls, "charge first ask questions later"

#####High Risk / High Reward Combat Types (for players who want a thrill)
- **Dual Pistols**, high mobility, fast rate of fire, jumps into fights and out just as easily

#####Commanders Types (for players who want to focus on the battlefield — team enhancement)
- **Big ass stationary gun**, high-damage, limited mobility
- **Augmented Boomerang**, provides team enhancements, high mobility, damage based on mobility

##### Unclassified
- **Chakram**, can throw chakrams that circle the player, medium mobility

- **Builder / Engineer**, since the terrain can change, maybe a weapon type that can alter the terrain may be neat
